#+title: TODOS

* TODO Shorterm :
** TODO Setup qmk userspace https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs_external_userspace
** TODO Combo for tab. I'd rather have A+R as TAB but those are currently bound to A_GRV.
** TODO Use emacs-next for editorconfig support. Enable it for qmk
** TODO Find a spot for < >
** TODO Find a spot for ^

* Navigation layer
+ Move left one character (left)
+ Move left one word (C-left) (shifted version? No. shift-left moves left but select the text)
      - Maybe do this one as a tap dance ? And add a repeat key on a thumb to avoid double-clicking multiple times


+ Move to beginning of line (home)
+ Move to beginning of buffer (C-home)

** TODO As a tap-dance. Single: left. Double: home
home brings us to the beginning of the line, left moves us by one character and Ctrl-left moves one word.

* Number row or numpad ?

* TODO Mod-tap Flow tap ?
* TODO Oneshot modifiers
+ Hitting ctrl or shift or alt would apply it to the next key
+ Hitting ctrl+alt (a combo) would ctrl+alt the next key

* Toggle layers inspired from Ben Vallack's keymap

+ In any layer except the base layer, the second thumb key will bring us back to the base layer
+ In all layers, the third thumb key will bring us to the next layer
+ This gives us a *panic mode* key sequence. Hitting in succession the third and the second thumb key will always bring us back to the base layer.
** TODO In the base layer, the second thumb key is still available (tap and held)
** TODO In the base layer, the third thumb key is still available (held)
** TODO In all the other layers, the second and third thumb keys are available (held)

* OSL for symbols ?
That could work for most symbols, like ~, /,
Some other symbols come in pairs, such as «», (), {}, []

* TODO Figure out the problem where key sequences (from combos) are sent too quickly to RDP
See https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/19671 as a starting point.
The problem is mentioned in https://docs.qmk.fm/mod_tap#caveats

* TODO Figure out a way to output french accents
** Analysis

| Letter | Number of accented versions of that letter | [[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9quence_d%27apparition_des_lettres][Frequency]]                   |
| A      | 2 (À, Â)                                   | (0.31%, 0.03%)              |
| C      | 1 (Ç)                                      | (0.06%)                     |
| E      | 4 (É, È, Ê, Ë)                             | (1.94%, 0.31%, 0.08%, 0.01% |
| I      | 2 (Î Ï)                                    | (0.03%, 0.01%)              |
| O      | 1 (Ô)                                      | (0.04%)                     |
| U      | 2 (Ù, Û)                                   | (0.02%, 0.02%)              |

** As combos
+ Efficient as it only requires one keypress to output an accented key.
+ Easy to remember. The combo always includes the key to accent and a key that represent the accent.
      - ~a+x = â~
      - ~e+x = ê~
      - ~i+x = î~
+ Some combos are hard to press. ~a+x~ for example.
+ Some are easy to type in a sequence with another letters while other are not.

*************** TODO Can I hold a combo to have the shifted version ?
*************** END

*** TODO Combos that use two hands are fast and comfortable. Adapt the ones that are uncomfortable
For example, ~a+x~ sucks. Let's mirror it for ~a+.~
~a+r (à)~ would become ~a+i~.

** As tap dance
*************** TODO Can the repeat key be used as the second tap of a tap dance ?
*************** END
+ Some letters would require three taps
+ Easy to remember as I can group the accented letters under their unaccented version.
** As keys on another layer
+ Two keypresses
+ I could use a oneshot layer, making it more comfortable.
+ I'd have to learn that layout, even though some accented letters could be positioned on top of the regular letter.

* Do I like auto shift key ?

* Combos
+ Return
+ Backspace
+ Parentheses, curly and square brackets

* Rewrite a mouse layer

* TODO Enable high resolution scrolling
